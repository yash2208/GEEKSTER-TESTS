      <p>
        What is initialization and declaration? Check if for a given length and
        breadth, is the shape a square or rectangle. (e.g.: Let's say the length
        is 10 and breadth is 20, and then check).

        <b>Ans-</b> Declaration tells the compiler about the existence of an
        entity in the program and its location. When you declare a variable, you
        should also initialize it. Initialization is the process of assigning a
        value to the Variable. Every programming language has its own method of
        initializing the variable.
